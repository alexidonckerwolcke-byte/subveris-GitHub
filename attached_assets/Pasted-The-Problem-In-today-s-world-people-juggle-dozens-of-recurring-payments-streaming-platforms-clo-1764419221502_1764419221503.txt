The Problem

In today’s world, people juggle dozens of recurring payments — streaming platforms, cloud storage, gym memberships, insurance plans, SaaS tools, and more.
Most individuals:

Don’t know exactly where their money goes every month,

Forget to cancel unused services, and

Overestimate how much budget they actually have available.

Existing personal finance apps (like Mint, Rocket Money, or Dyme) show spending, but they don’t actively optimize or act on your behalf.
There’s no intelligent system that helps users rationalize, renegotiate, and replace subscriptions using real behavioral and usage data.

🚀 The Solution — SubSave

SubSave is an AI-driven SaaS platform that automatically detects, analyzes, and optimizes your subscriptions and recurring expenses.
It doesn’t just track your spending — it helps you spend smarter by combining financial data, behavioral psychology, and AI recommendations.

🔧 Key Features
1. Automatic Subscription Detection

Connects securely via Open Banking (PSD2 in Europe, Plaid/Yodlee in the US).

Automatically identifies recurring payments and classifies them as subscriptions, memberships, or utility bills.

2. Usage & Value Analysis

Tracks how often you actually use services (e.g., Netflix 2 times per month).

Calculates “cost per use” to show you the real value of each subscription.

Uses AI estimation if direct usage data isn’t available.

3. Behavioral Budget Coaching

Uses behavioral psychology principles to help you feel your financial decisions.

Highlights opportunity costs (e.g., “This unused gym membership equals 3 restaurant dinners”).

Encourages micro-goals: “Cancel one unused subscription this week and save $20/month.”

4. AI-Powered Optimization

Finds cheaper or better-value alternatives (e.g., “Switch from Adobe to Affinity — save $25/month”).

Automatically cancels or negotiates lower rates through API integrations or AI-generated cancellation letters.

5. Predictive Cashflow Engine

Simulates what your monthly finances would look like with and without certain subscriptions.

Predicts when future payments will cause cash flow issues and suggests preemptive actions.

6. Personal AI Financial Coach (“FinBot”)

A conversational AI that learns your habits and goals.

Gives actionable advice like:

“You could reach your $500/month savings goal by cutting 3 low-use subscriptions.”

Provides motivation and behavioral nudges, not just data.

💰 Business Model

Freemium Tier – Free access to basic detection, overview, and insights.

🧠 Why It’s Unique

Current finance apps report your spending; SubSave acts on it.

Combines open banking + behavioral science + AI optimization — a trio not yet done effectively.

Focuses on habit change and psychological motivation, not just cold numbers.

Solves a daily problem most people have: invisible financial leakage from subscriptions.
